YtAutoDark
==========

Automatically switch Youtube to its built-in dark theme.

#### Background

It's possible to use Youtube built-in dark theme, by enabling it using the dedicated menu.
But, if like me you automatically clean cache, cookies, history, ...
before closing your browser, you need to manually enable it each time you start the browser
and navigate to youtube.
It might even be worse if you automatically clean cookies after closing tabs:
expect to re-enable it each time you close all youtube tabs.

I've made this extension so that it will enable Youtube dark theme automatically for me.
After hours of research, I've finally managed to find how to make it work, so I can share it here.
